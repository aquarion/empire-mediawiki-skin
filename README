Note to PD IT:

Seperate directory for skins so we can manage changes to them with git.

Note to Github users:

This is a repository for PD's mediawiki skins, primarily used for the public wiki (Plot & Crew wiki skins will appear at some point).

If you are able to fix a bug in the skins, please take a fork of this, and submit your changes as a merge request.

Primary issues remaining:

* These skins do not work even a little bit with the new Mediawiki skins engine, which breaks our ability to upgrade mediawiki and make search suck less. Assistance appreciated.
